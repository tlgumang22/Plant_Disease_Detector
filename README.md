# Plant Disease Recognition System

Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! This project aims to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases, enabling quick and informed decision-making for crop protection.

## Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection:** Utilizes advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN) for high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for a seamless user experience.
- **Fast Processing:** Quick analysis and results, enabling prompt action.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image:** Navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
2. **Analysis:** The system processes the image using a pre-trained model.
3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
